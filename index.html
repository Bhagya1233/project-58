        <p> My hobby is Reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go home from school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 10 years old and am in 5th grade now I know well that reading is one good habit Which can make me a complete person. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one person always happy, smart and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration, and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
